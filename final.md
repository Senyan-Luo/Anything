Alice Lee: I worked on the front-end development of the overall application which includes the home page, 
article page, archive page, and navigation bar. I implemented a masonry layout for the article page 
and creating the map icons on the home page. I prototyped the designs in the beginning and created digital prototypes in Figma. 

Senyan Luo: I led the project and completed the full-stack skeleton of the app. Throughout the project development, I also assisted teammates with debugging. 

Huy Le: I assisted with brainstorming ideas for our application, worked on our milestone.md's, as well as contributed to the front end and GUI of our application.

Madeline Ng: I worked on the front end development of the vocabulary builder page in collaboration with Senyan and created rotating flashcards that display the word in the front and the other information on the back. Together, we all brainstormed and explored variations of the News app concept and catering it to an audience that is different from us. Came up with ideas for slogan and app name. I created several digital prototypes using Adobe Xd. Contributed to the README.files.
