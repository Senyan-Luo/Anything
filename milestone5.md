Milestone 5

Our application would be catered to students outside of America trying to learn and improve on their English. With the application, they would be view trending articles and read them, allowing them to stay updated with what is happening around the world. In cases when they do not understand something, they are able to utilize the translation feature in order to learn what it means. Not only that, but when the user encounters an interesting read or a word they may want to look back at in the future, then they have the option to save it for future reference.
